# Explore Weather Trends

## Background
This was my very first project at [Udacity](udacity.com) part of [Data Analysis Nano Degree (DAND)](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

## Introduction
The goal was to run an intuitive data extraction, visualization and analysis on the similarities and differences between global temperature trends in comparision to a local city of interest (Riyadh).

## Procedure
Extract the data from the database using SQl provided in the Udacity portal.<br>
Create a line chart for the data obtained.<br>
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world average temperature with the local average temperature.

## Conclusion
The final analysis will take the form of a PDF document which contains a plot of the data trends, and outlines taken:<br>
An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:

# Tools Used
1- Python<br>
2- SQL<br>
3- Excel

# Submission
1- How to calculate Moving Averages?<br>
* How to visualize the trends between local and global average temperatures?<br>
- Plot the chart with local and global temperature trends<br>
- Write up at least four observations about the similarities and differences in the trends.
